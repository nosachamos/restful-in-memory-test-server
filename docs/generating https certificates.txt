Install mkcert from here:

https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases

or use the provided one in the "cert" folder.

If you chose to download a new binary, rename it to just "mkcert.exe" for simplicity. Add mkcert.exe to your PATH env variable.

Then run:

mkcert -install

Accept the prompt to install the local CA.

Navigate to the config folder of the server project, then run:

mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

This will create the key and certificate you need. Make sure the server.ts file is pointing to the correct key and certificate file names.

You can now start the server and navigate to a localhost address using HTTPS without any issues.
